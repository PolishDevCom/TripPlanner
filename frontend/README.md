# TripPlanner Frontend

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - latest LTS or current version
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) - latest version

#### Node.js version

In [prerequisites](#prerequisites) there's a statement recommending

> latest LTS or current version of node.js

If for whatever reason your development environment is acting strange (dev server not starting, something's off, etc.), please ensure you're using the version of node.js specified in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc). If you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, all you have to do is to run `nvm use` while in `TripPlanner - Project/TripPlannerFrontend`. `nvm use` will install and use version of node.js specified in `.nvmrc`.

cd TripPlanner/frontend &&\
yarn
